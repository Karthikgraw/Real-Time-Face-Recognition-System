The project comprises two key components: a training module and a recognition module. The training module 
processes a dataset of facial images, extracting features using the Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm,
and creates a model that associates each face with a unique identifier. The recognition module utilizes this model 
to identify and label faces in live video streams from a webcam.The system is built using OpenCV for computer vision tasks and 
supports additional libraries like Pillow for image processing. FaceGuard is ideal for applications in security, surveillance, 
and personal identification, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-time face recognition needs.
